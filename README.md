## Introduction

In this project, we are trying to predict different arrhythmia on ECG.  
We will be using the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/) that contains 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings, obtained from 47 subjects studied by the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory between 1975 and 1979.

**Arrtythmia Dataset:** 

    Number of Samples: 109446  
    Number of Categories: 5  
    Sampling Frequency: 125Hz  
    Data Source: Physionet's MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset  
    Classes: ['N': 0, 'S': 1, 'V': 2, 'F': 3, 'Q': 4]  
    
    -N : Non-ecotic beats (normal beat)  
    -S : Supraventricular ectopic beats  
    -V : Ventricular ectopic beats  
    -F : Fusion Beats  
    -Q : Unknown Beats
